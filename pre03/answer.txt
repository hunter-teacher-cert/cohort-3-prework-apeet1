What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

Begin at main. Main outputs "No,[space]I[space]" and then invokes zoop.
When invoked, zoop invokes baffle, which outputs "wug" and then invokes ping.
When invoked, ping outputs "." and [newline].
The program returns to complete zoop by outputting "You[space]wugga[space]" on the next line and invokes baffle again, which outputs "wug", invokes ping, and outputs "." and [newline].
The program returns to to complete main by outputting "I [space]" and then invokes baffle once again, outputting "wug", invoking ping,outputting "." and [newline].

The program prints:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.
