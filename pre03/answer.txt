What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

Begin at main. Main outputs "No, I " and then invokes zoop.
When invoked, zoop invokes baffle, which outputs "wug" and then invokes ping.
When invoked, ping outputs "."
The program returns to complete zoop by outputting "You wugga " on the next line and invokes baffle again, which outputs "wug", invokes ping, and outputs "."
The program returns to to complete main by outputting "I " and then invokes baffle once again, outputting "wug", invoking ping,outputting "."

The program prints:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.
